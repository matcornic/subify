Thanks so much for wanting to help! We really appreciate it.

* Have an idea for a new feature?
* Want to add a new built-in theme?

Excellent! You've come to the right place.

1. If you find a bug or wish to suggest a new feature, please create an issue first
2. Make sure your code & comment conventions are in-line with the project's style (execute gometalinter as in [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) file)
3. Make your commits and PRs as tiny as possible - one feature or bugfix at a time
4. Write detailed commit messages, in-line with the project's commit naming conventions
